  <h2>What does a Front End Eningeer do?</h2>
  <section>
    <section class="child">
    Front end engineers plan, design, build, and implement the user interface systems of websites, software programs, and web-based applications. Their primary goal is to provide a satisfactory user experience with no issues, errors, or downtime. They create and optimize systems, play an active role in testing and troubleshooting, and resolve issues such as those related to accessibility and browser compatibility. They often serve as an intermediary bridging the gap between the user and the backend developers, and tweak tools and platforms to adapt to real-world use situations.
    </section>
    <section class="child">
    Front end engineers typically have vocational training or are self-taught and life-long learners. They should have some work or project expereince in software development. They must be proficient with the use of front end technologies and have a strong willingess to learn quickly as they work in collaboration with other stakeholders.
